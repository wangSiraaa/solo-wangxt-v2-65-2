"""
Exact trie algorithms for shadow analysis and semantic policy diff.

Prefix space is partitioned into *cells* inside which every rule's match
result is constant.  Partition cuts come from:

  1. base prefix boundaries (containment edges),
  2. ge/le length-range boundaries (min_len / max_len + 1).

Because depths only go to 32 / 128 and rule counts are in the low hundreds,
a binary trie (one node per address bit along inserted bases) plus a length
scan <= 128 is fast enough and stays fully exact — nothing is sampled.

    Minimal prefix set that demonstrates every behavior change.

    Method (fully exact, no sampling):

    1. For every depth k = 0..maxlen the address axis [0, 2^k) is tiled by
       SEGMENTS.  A block at depth k is decided either by a trie node cell
       (a rule base sits exactly there) or by the nearest ancestor node's
       GAP region (the part of its subtree outside direct-child subtrees).
       Each segment carries a state signature (old winner seq, new winner
       seq); a segment with different old/new actions is a changed segment.
    2. Segments are merged into maximal uniform regions with a DSU:
         * horizontally: two consecutive /k blocks with the same signature;
         * vertically:   a /k segment contained in the /(k-1) segment with
                         the same signature.
       This deliberately ignores trie nodes whose rules never win anything
       (shadowed bases cannot split a behavior region).
    3. One witness prefix per changed region (its first member block).
